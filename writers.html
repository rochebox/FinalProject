					<h3>Chloe Chidera Ene
					</h3>
					<p><strong>Position:</strong> Executive Producer/Music Director</p>
					<p><strong>About the show:</strong> It's incredible how much we've done in such a short time. Every person in the class put in a lot of time and effort. I think this show has a lot of potential.</p>
					<p><strong>Favorite joke in the Writers' room:</strong> Jo spills about her entire life. Joseph goes "That's lovely" and Payton</p>
					<p><strong>Plans for the future</strong> The team is flying out to San Diego for Comicon next year to promote the 2nd season. I'm looking forward to that.</p>

					<p><strong>About the show:</strong> Gaslight is a really cool show. It plays on the psychology that can only be accessed in the deepest corners of the human mind. In that it is the only show of its kind.</p>
					<p><strong>Favorite joke in the Writers' room:</strong> Dance!</p>

					<p><strong>Favorite joke in the Writers' rooms</strong> Hardcore Gaslit. When I said it for the first time I was roasted, and now it is one of the classes favorite term.</p>
